### Results

### Operational Excellence Pillar

- Support development and run workloads effectively
- Gain insight into workload operations
- Continuously improve processes and procedures to deliver business value.

Best practices:  
- Perform operations as code  
- Make frequent, small, reversible changes  
- Refine operations procedures frequently
- Anticipate failure 
- Learn from all operational failures

### Security Pillar
 - Protect data, systems and assets to take advantage of cloud technologies to improve your security
 
 Best practices:
 - Implement a strong identity foundation
 - Enable tracability
 - Apply security at all layers
 - Automate security best practices
 - Protect data in transit and at rest
 - Keep people away from data
 - Prepare for security events
 
 ### Reliability Pillar
 - Ensuring a workload can perform its intended function correctly and consistently when it's expected to
 - This includes the ability to operate and test the workload through its total lifecycle
 
 Best practices:
 - Automatically recover from failure
 - Test recovery procedures
 - Scale horizontally to increase aggregate workload availability
 - Stop guessing capacity
 - Manage change in automation
 
 ### Performance Efficiency Pillar
 - The ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve
 
 Best practices:
 - Democratize advanced technologies (use provided services)
 - Go global in minutes
 - Use serverless architectures
 - Experiment more often
 - Consider mechanical sympathy (understand the system and their purpose to utilise them to best effect)

 ### Cost Optimization Pillar
- The ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point

Best practices:
- Implement Cloud Financial Management
- Adopt a consumption model
- Measure overall efficiency
- Stop spending money on undifferentiated heavy lifting
- Analyze and attribute expenditure

**The Four Advantages** 

* #1 - Pay as You Go:  
Pay per use is great because it eliminates overcapacity and wasted computing resources.  

* #2 - Pay Less by Using More:  
Sophisticated users of AWS can save a lot by dynamically moving workloads between services and creating economies of scale.  

* #3 - Save When You Reserve:  
Amazon provides a lot of price flexibility. You can significantly cut costs by committing to 1 years or more - itâ€™s possible to do this selectively for some workloads, while using others on demand. The spot instances option is a creative one, which lets anyone with expertise, and the time to architect a spot instances solution, shave 60% off costs.  

* #4 - Free Usage Tier:  
Amazon grants 1 year of free usage with generous quotas for many of its services, to reduce risk and encourage cloud adoption. This was a primary way AWS gained its initial market share in the early years.


**CapEx vs OpEx**


Capital Expenditure (CapEx): It is the initial spending of money on physical infrastructure, and then deducting that up-front expense over time. The up-front cost from CapEx has a value that reduces over time. All expenses incurred for long-term benefits in the future lie under CapEx.  

Operational Expenditure (OpEx): It is like a pay-as-you-go service. You can deduct this expense in the same year you spend it. There is no up-front cost, as you pay for a service or product as you use it. It is as the name suggests, the expense of daily operation.

Context |CapEx |OpEx|
|-----|--------|----|
|Upfront cost|Significant|None|
|Ongoing cost|Low|Based on usage|
|Tax Deduction|Over-time|Same year|
|Early Termination|No|Anytime|
|Maintenance|Significant|Low|
|Value over time|Lowers|No change|

The primary benefit of a CapEx model is stability: You know exactly what your costs are, at least on an annual basis, if not a longer timeline. But that cost comes with unpredictable results attached to it. Your initial cost and how it will depreciate or be amortized over time is a certainty, but the true value of that investment to your company each subsequent year is yet to be determined.

An easy example of these two would be:  
* CapEx: Physical on-premise servers  
* OpEx: Cloud servers
